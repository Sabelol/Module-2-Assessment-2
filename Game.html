    <p>A bit about our past

The first GAME store opened in Durban, South Africa, in 1970. It was born out of the belief by its founders that shopping had become a tedious and boring pastime. They wanted to create a fun shopping environment and so conceptualized retailing as a game. The signature shocking pink has still prevailed to this day.

We operate out of 150 stores in 12 African countries.</p>
             
             
    <p>We procure quality products at the best available prices. By operating a lean and efficient business, supported by a strong and talented team, we are able to provide our customers with a tailored range of high-quality food, grocery and general merchandise products at competitive prices.</p>
